                    I understand a Covid-19 pre-departure PCR test is required within 72 hours of the scheduled flight departure for travellers entering or transiting Singapore. How will the 72-hour period be counted?​​

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Passengers on direct flights to Singapore​​​ The 72 hours will be counted from the scheduled departure of the flight to Singapore. For example, if the flight is scheduled to depart on 30 June 2021, the Covid-19 PCR test must be taken
                        no earlier than 27 June 2021.​​ Passengers who are taking a connecting flight to Singapore​​​ (i) the 72 hours will be counted from the scheduled departure day of the first flight of his journey to Singapore if the total scheduled
                        transit duration does not exceed 24 hours. For example, if the passenger’s flight itinerary is Los Angeles-Tokyo-Singapore and his transit duration at NRT is within 24 hours, the COVID-19 PCR test must be taken within 72 hours
                        before the scheduled departure day of his flight from Los Angeles. Or, (ii) the 72 hours will be counted from the scheduled departure day of his last flight of his journey to Singapore (i.e. the flight to Singapore) if the total
                        scheduled transit duration exceeds 24 hours. For example, if the passenger’s flight itinerary is Los Angeles-Tokyo-Hong Kong-Singapore and his total scheduled transit duration at NRT and HKG adds up to more than 24 hours, the COVID-19
                        PCR test must be taken within 72 hours before the scheduled departure day of his flight from HKG.​ Please note the above requirements also apply to Singapore Citizens and permanent residents. The following travellers are exempted
                        from taking the pre-departure test:​​​​ Children aged 2 years and below​​ Those who have stayed in lower-risk countries/regions in the last 21 days before departure for Singapore. This currently applies to travellers from Australia,
                        Brunei Darussalam, Mainland China, New Zealand, Hong Kong SAR and Macau. Travellers from lower-risk countries/regions are either required to take a Covid-19 test upon arrival in lieu of Stay-Home Notice (SHN), or are required to
                        serve a 7-day SHN at their place of residence with a Covid-19 test administered at the end of their SHN.</p>
